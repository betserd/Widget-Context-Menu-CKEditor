# Widget-Context-Menu-CKEditor
A CKEditor plugin which makes it possible to edit, copy and remove widgets using the right click context menu. This overcomes the problems of some widgets that are difficult to select. The name of the widget in the context menu is the title of the outer element, if that does not exist it shows the name of the widget.

config.widgetcontextmenu_edit = false;
